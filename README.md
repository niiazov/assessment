# assessment
Used maven to bulid this project, and code is written in Java language.
Created a class with a method to return the length and the longest word in a sentence. For example. “The cow jumped over the moon.” should return 6 and “jumped”.
Created unit tests, that's reworking code as needed.
Put assumptions in comments.

In order to execute the test, you need to run MyClassTest class, 
which is located in the "src/test/java" folder and under the "tests" package.
In the MyClassTest class, there are multiple test methods, which tests different parameters like empty, null value and single word sentences.
Also explanations about the tests can be found as comments in MyClassTest class.
